Abstract
We consider a continuous time inventory system with two types of inventories, 
namely main inventory (MI) and defective inventory (DI). The arrival times of cus
tomers in the system follow a Poisson process. We adopt the (s, S) ordering policy. 
When the order is received, the received items are fully inspected and segregated 
into perfect and defective items. These items are stored separately in MI and DI 
respectively. The defective items are then repaired individually and delivered to MI 
after repair. If there is no item in MI, even if DI has either a positive inventory or 
no inventory, the incoming customer joins the orbit of retrial customers and tries to 
meet his demand again after a random time. The lead time, repair time, and retrial 
time follow independent exponential distributions. We derived the joint probability 
distribution of the number of customers in orbit, the level of MI, and the level of 
DI. Some key system performance measures are derived and these measures are 
used to calculate the expected total cost. The results are illustrated numerically 
using Julia software.

1 Introduction
After Harris (1913) introduced the concept of economic order quantity(EOQ) model, 
many researchers focused on the same in the following years (see (Schwarz 1972; 
Lowe and Schwarz 1983; Porteus 1985, 1986b), etc.). In most inventory systems, it is 
implicitly assumed that the batch ordered by the procurement manager had no defects 
upon delivery and that the quality of each unit of product in the batch accepted by

the company was completely acceptable to the company’s customers. But in reality, 
most people’s everyday experiences support the phenomenon of defective items. Due 
to product quality issues, department stores face a large number of product returns 
from consumers.
Shih (1980) introduced the concept of defective items in the deterministic EOQ 
model. In this article he expanded on two inventory models, a deterministic EOQ 
Model and a stochastic one-period model for the case where the proportion of defec
tive units in the accepted lot is a random variable with a known probability distri
bution. Subsequently, Porteus (1986a) analyzed that in the production process of a 
lot, the process can go out of control and producing defective units throughout the 
production of the current lot. This paper focused on improvement of quality control 
and finding the optimal lot size to minimize the production of defective items and it 
revealed the significant relationship between the quality and lot size.
Following the work of Shih (1980) and Porteus (1986a), many researchers focused 
on the study of defective items in the deterministic EOQ model (see for example, 
(Schwaller 1988; Cheng 1991; Eroglu and Ozdemir 2007)). Over the last two decades, 
many researchers focused on dealing with these defective items during production 
time in EPQ inventory (see (Sarkar and Saren 2016)) or during the ordered lot arrival 
time in EOQ inventory (see (Yoo et al. 2009; Öztürk 2021; Öztürk and Konstantaras 
2025)). Lee and Rosenblatt (1987) was the first paper which extended the applica
tion of economic manufacturing quantity (EMQ) to deteriorating production systems 
and this paper dealt with the simultaneous determination of EMQ and inspections 
schedules with no inspection errors. Salameh and Jaber (2000) extended the tradi
tional EPQ/EOQ model by accounting for imperfect quality items when using the 
EPQ/EOQ formulae. They assumed a 100% screening process with no human error. 
An error in their paper was corrected by Cardenas-Barron (2009). Khan et al. (2011) 
extended the work of Salameh and Jaber (2000) by assuming inspection errors. Since 
then, numerous researchers have addressed the issue of imperfect items with inspec
tion errors (for recent papers, see (Wangsa and Wee 2019; Öztürk 2021; Asadkhani 
et al. 2022; Nobil et al. 2024; Namnabat et al. 2025; Öztürk and Konstantaras 2025) 
and references therein).
In all the above works, the authors studied that when inventory is replenished with 
the ordered/produced items, inspection takes place to verify the quality of the items 
and that during the inspection, the items which are found out as defective are either 
reworked/repaired, replaced or disposed. Additionally, this kind of works were con
sidered only in the literature of periodic-review inventory systems. However, Siva
kumar and Anbazhagan (2011); Saranya and Shophia Lawrence (2019) and Saranya 
et al. (2022) studied the continuous review inventory system with replacement and 
refurbishment of perished/failed items. In this paper, we adopt the concept of inspec
tion in a continuous review inventory system where the inspection is carried out on 
receipt of the order and after the error-free inspection, the items are separated into 
perfect and defective items which can be repaired. For example, furniture, electronic 
and mechanical goods and household items may be damaged during transport, but 
these damages can be repaired after the items have been inspected after delivery.
Continuous-review inventory systems with retrial demands/customers have been 
studied by many researchers during the last few decades. Artalejo et al. (2006) was 
1 3

   23 
the first article to address the concept of retrial in inventory under the assumption of 
Poisson requirements, exponentially distributed lead time, and exponentially distrib
uted time between retrials.
Following Artalejo et al. (2006); Ushakumari (2006) considered a retrial inventory 
system with a classic retrial policy and (Krishnamoorthy and Jose 2007) analyzed 
three different retrial inventory systems with positive service time and positive lead 
time. Sivakumar (2008) considered a two-commodity substitutable inventory system 
with a common ordering policy and retrial demands. Sivakumar (2009) considered 
a perishable inventory system with retrial demands and a finite number of sources 
for generating requests. Arivarignan et al. (2008) studied a perishable inventory sys
tem with service facilities, MAP arrival of demands, and exponential time between 
retrials. Padmavathi et al. (2015) considered a retrial inventory system with single 
and modified multiple vacation for servers. Karthick et al. (2015) studied a retrial 
inventory with two types of customers and an exponential time between retrials for 
type 1 customers. Arivarignan et al. (2020) analyzed a production inventory system 
with a “made-to-stock” production policy, a renewal process for incoming Demand, 
exponential production times and exponential intermediate repetition times. Melikov 
et al. (2022) considered a retrial queuing-inventory system with primary, repeat and 
feedback customers.
This article is organized as follows: In the following section, the mathematical 
model of the paper is described. In Sect. 3, the detailed analysis of the model is 
presented and in Sect. 4, some system performance measures in the steady state is 
derived and the total cost function is calculated. The numerical computations of the 
paper are given in Sect. 5.

2 Model description
We consider a continuous review retrial inventory system with two types of invento
ries namely main inventory(MI) and defective inventory(DI). Let 
L1(t
 and 
respectively, denote the inventory level of DI and MI at time t. The maximum inven
tory of the system is 
L2(t)
L1(t)+L2(t)=
We have the following assumptions:
● The customer requesting a single item arrives at the system following a Poisson 
process with the rate 
λ(>
and the demand of the customer is satisfied with an 
item from MI.
L1(t)+L2(t)=
● The (s, S) ordering policy is adopted: That is, when the joint inventory level drops 
to s, (i.e., 
), we place an order for 
 items. Ordered 
items are received after an exponentially distributed lead time with parameter 
β(>
.
Q(=S−s
● The inspection policy is defined as follows: After receipt of an order, all items re
ceived are subjected to an error-free inspection. After inspection, these items are 
separated into perfect and defective items. The probability for k defective items 
in a lot of Q items is denoted by 
bk
The perfect items and the defective items are 
stored in MI and DI respectively. We note that the inspection time is negligible.
● The items in the DI are repaired individually. After repaired, they will be ac
commodated in MI. The repair time follows an exponential distribution with the 
parameter 
µ(>
.
● If the MI is zero and the DI has either a positive stock or zero, the arriving cus
tomer joins the orbit of retrial customers and tries again after a random period 
of time following an exponential distribution with the parameter 
constant retrial policy is adopted here.

at time t can be described by a process

, where 
are defined in the Sect. 2. From our assumptions made on the input 
and output processes in Sect. 2, it can be seen that the stochastic process Z(t) is a 
continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) with state space

3.1 Stability analysis
In this subsection, we derive the stability condition of the CTMC Z(t). From the 
structure of the infinitesimal generator matrix P,  the CTMC Z(t) is irreducible. To 
derive the condition for positive recurrence of the CTMC, we first consider the matrix 
A=A0+A1+A

Let

Proof From the well known result of Neuts (1994) (Equation 3.1.4 page no. 83), on 
the positive recurrence of P,  the CTMC Z(t) is positive recurrent if and only if
ΠA0e<ΠA2e
By exploiting the structure of

 and 
 the lemma follows.  
In this subsection, we determine the joint probability distribution of the number of 
customers in the orbit, on-hand DI level and on-hand MI level in steady state by using 
the matrix geometric methods (Neuts 1994). From the structure of the rate matrix P 
and stability condition in (8), the CTMC Z(t) with state space 
 is regular. Hence the 
limiting probability distribution defined by
ψ(i,j,k)=lim t→∞
Pr[X(t)=i,L1(t)=j,L2(t)=k|(X(0),L1(0),L2
exists and is independent of the initial state.
Let 
ψ=(ψ(0),ψ(1),...
, be the steady state probability vector of P where

and the vector 
ψ(0
 is the unique solution to the equations
ψ(0)(B0+RA2)=0,
ψ(0)(I−R)−1e=1

Proof The proof of the theorem follows from the well-known results of Neuts (1994) 
(Theorem 3.1.1 page no. 82).  
4 System performance measures
In this section, we derive some system performance measures of the system in the 
steady state and using these measures, we construct the total expected cost per unit 
time. 
1. Expected MI level: Let 
Since 
ψ(i,j,k
ξ
 denote the expected MI level in the steady state. 
 gives the steady state probability vector for k-th MI level when the 
number of customers in the orbit is i and the on-hand DI level is j, the expected 
MI level is given by 
ξMI=

2. Expected Inventory Level of DI: Let the expected DI level be denoted by 
Since

ξDI
 gives the steady state probability vector for j-th DI level when the 
number of customers in the orbit is i with a component specifies the on-hand MI

level, 
ψ(i,j)
 gives the probability that the DI level is (i, j) in the steady state. 
Hence the expected DI level is given by 
ξDI=

3. Expected Reorder Rate: Let the expected reorder rate be denoted by 
steady state. To compute the mean reorder rate

 in the 
 we consider events of triggering 
an order which occur when joint inventory level drops from 
s
 to s,  provided 
at least one item in the MI. That is when 
L2(t)≥
L1(t)+L2(t)=s+1
 and 
a customer arrival or a retrial, if any, from orbit triggers the order. Hence the 
expected reorder rate is given by 
ξR=

ψ(i,j,s+1−j)(λ+¯ δi0θ)
4. Expected Number of Customers in the Orbit: Let 
ξ
(13)
 denote the expected number 
of customers in the orbit in the steady state. Since 
ψ(i
 gives the steady state 
probability vector for i number of customers in the orbit with the components 
specify the MI level and the DI level, the quantity 
ψ(i)
 gives the probability that 
the number of customers in the orbit is i in the steady state. Hence the expected 
number of customers in the orbit is given by 
ξO=
∞ ∑
i=1
iψ(i)e=ψ(1)(I−R)−2e
5. Expected Repair Rate of Defective Inventories: Let

 denote the expected repair 
rate of defective inventories in the steady state and it is given by

5 Numerical analysis
In this section, we provide some numerical examples that illustrate performance 
of the inventory model under study. In Sect. 5.1, we study the optimality of total 
expected cost and the effect of costs on the optimal values and the influence of system 
parameters on the optimal values of S, s and TC. In Sect. 5.2, we determine the opti
mality of expected waiting time and the impact of system parameters on the optimal 
values of S, s and 
ξW
We analyze the joint optimazation of total expected cost and 
expected waiting time and the impact of system parameters and costs on the optimal 
values of S, s, TC and 
ξ
 in the Sect. 5.3.
We denote the optimal values of S, s, TC and 
ξ∗
ξ
 respectively by 
S∗,s∗,TC
 and 
 throughout this numerical section.
It is quite challenging to demonstrate the convexity analytically because of the 
complexity of the cost function that is derived in Sect. 4. Therefore, we make use of 
numerical methods. Researchers favor meta-heuristic algorithms like ant colony opti
mization, simulated annealing, etc or derivative free algorithm like, Nelder-Mead, 
Pattern search, etc for this kind of complex functions with integer decision variables. 
To determine the optimal values in this study, we employ the mesh adaptive direct 
search (MADS) algorithm. This is an extension of the generalized pattern search 
technique. In Audet and Dennis (2006), MADS was first introduced. We suggest that 
the reader visit (Audet and Hare 2017) for a thorough analysis and the mathematical 
foundation of the MADS algorithm.
We utilize Julia software and its packages for all computational tasks performed in 
the ensuing two subsections. Deriving the 
values is necessary in order to compute 
the cost functions and system performance metrics. The R matrix must be computed

in order to derive the 
 values. Using the logarithmic reduction algorithm (LRA) 
(see (Latouche and Ramaswami 1993)), which is a quadratically converging algo
rithm, the matrix R is found since there is no simple structure that can be exploited. 
Through the use of LRA and setting 
ϵ=10−15
we have developed a Julia program 
to compute the R matrix. With the Julia program, we were able to determine system 
performance metrics including the expected waiting time and the total expected cost. 
To determine the optimal values of the total expected cost and expected waiting time, 
we use NOMAD.jl (see (Montoison et al. 2020)), a package in Julia for MADS algo
rithm. In order to confirm the optimality of the solution that NOMAD offers, we list 
values of the objective function in the neighborhood of the optimal values provided 
by NOMAD.
5.1 Optimization of the cost function
In this subsection, we have derived the optimality of the cost function and the optimal 
values of S and s numerically. We have also studied the impact of the system param
eters and the costs on the optimal values 
TC
 of cost function and the optimal values 
S∗, s
 of inventory’s maximum capacity and the reorder level.
5.1.1 Convexity of the optimal cost function
In this subsection, we have carried out the numerical study to analyze the con
vex nature of the total cost function. Since it is difficult to examine the quali
tative behavior of the cost function because of its complex form, we have 
conducted a thorough numerical study using the Julia program in order to ana
lyze the convex nature of the cost function. For this study, we fix the system 
parameters as 
λ=4, µ=5.5, θ=4.2, β=0.15, p=0.

5.1.2 Effect of system parameters on optimal values
This subsection examines how system parameters affect optimal values. To do this, 
we vary the following system parameters: the customer’s arrival rate λ; the repair 
rate for defective item µ; the retrial rate of the orbiting customer θ; the reorder rate 
β and the probability of receiving defective items p. For this study, we set the cost 
values to ch1
=2, ch2
=1.5, cs=100, cr=20, cw=10. By varying the system 
parameters, we obtain the optimal values S∗,s∗ and TC∗ with NOMAD. We pres
ent the optimal values S∗, s∗ as upper entries and the corresponding TC∗ as lower 
entries in Table 2. We observe the following from Table 2.
 ● The optimal values S∗,s∗ and the corresponding TC∗ increase as the arrival rate 
λ of customers increases. As customer arrival rates increase, maintaining higher 
inventory levels helps managers to prevent frequent shortages and to prevent 
more customers entering into the orbit.
 ● As the retrial rate θ increases, the optimal value S∗ increases, but the optimal 
reorder level s∗ and the corresponding optimal total cost decrease. Increasing 
the retrial rate leads to higher demand from orbit and consequently reduces the 
number of customers and their waiting time in orbit. Therefore, the maximum 
inventory level S must be kept high to meet the requirements of retrial customers 
in addition to the requirements of primary customers.
 ● Increasing the repair rate µ increases the total cost TC∗ and s∗. However, there 
is no consistent pattern in S∗. This is because the inflow to the MI will gradually 
increase due to the high repair rate of DI, which is why the determination of the 
maximum inventory cannot be precisely predicted.
 ● As the probability value p increases, the optimal values S∗ and s∗ decrease and 
TC∗ increases. As the reorder rate β increases, the maximum inventory level S 
must be kept high and the reorder level must be kept as low as possible. This is 
reflected in the results.
5.1.3 Influence of costs on optimal values
In this subsection, we analyze the influence of costs on optimal values by varying 
the costs defined in the previous section. For this study, we set the system parameter 
values as the follows: λ=4, µ=5.5, θ=4.2, β=0.15, and p=0.2. By varying 
the costs, we obtain the optimal values S∗,s∗ and TC∗ with NOMAD. In the Table 3, 
we present the optimal values S∗,s∗ as upper entries and the corresponding optimal 
cost values TC∗ in the lower entry. The following can be seen from Table 3.
 ● As the setup cost cs, and the waiting cost cw increase, the optimal inventory level 
S∗ increases. Of course, when setup costs are high, frequent ordering increases 
the total expected cost of the system. To prevent this, we need to maintain a 
higher level of inventory in the system.
 ● The optimal inventory level S∗ decreases when the holding costs of DI ch2
, the 
holding costs of MI ch1
 and the repair costs of DI cr increase. It is evident that 
keeping more inventory will raise the total expected cost because we will need 
1 3
Page 15 of 33    23 
S. Sivadasan, S. L. Arputham
to lower the maximum inventory level due to rising storage and repair expenses.
 ● As costs cw and cr increase, the optimal reorder level s∗ increases, and as cost ch1
 
increases, s∗ decreases. To prevent customers from having to wait due to insuf
ficient inventory, the reorder level must be set higher if waiting costs are high. 
We need to maintain a higher reorder point because if we keep the maximum 
inventory so low, we may be at risk of running out of stock. Furthermore, it is 
obvious that the reorder value must be set low even if the holding cost of perfect 
inventory increases. We also note that the optimal value S∗ decreases as repair 
costs cr increase.
 ● When the costs cs and ch2
 increase, the pattern of the optimal reordering point 
s∗ cannot be predicted and does not have a consistent pattern. This is because the 
decision on placement of an order and the reorder point is completely influenced 
by the level of DI and setup costs.
 ● The optimal total cost TC∗ increases in tandem with that of all system costs.
5.2 Optimization of the expected waiting time
In this subsection, we concentrate on minimizing the waiting time of a retrial cus
tomer in the orbit and address the role that system parameters play in this process. 
The Table 4 displays the optimal values of the expected waiting time ξ∗
W in the lower 
entries with the corresponding optimal values S∗ and s∗ in the upper entries. From 
the Table 4, we made the following observations:
 ● The optimal waiting time and the corresponding optimal values S∗ and s∗ do not 
exhibit any pattern of increasing or decreasing as the arrival rate λ and p increase.
 ● As µ increases, so does the the optimal waiting time. However there is oscillation 
in the corresponding optimal values S∗ and s∗.
 ● When β increases, ξ∗
W decreases while S∗ increases. But s∗ is fluctuating.
 ● With the increase of θ, ξ∗
W decreases, but the corresponding optimal values S∗ 
and s∗ oscillate.
5.3 Joint optimization of waiting time and total cost
In the previous two subsections, we have examined the optimality of TC(S, s) and 
ξW individually. But to understand the analysis more fully, we need to perform the 
joint optimization of the total cost and the waiting time. Therefore, we formulate the 
following a nonlinear bi-objective program (NLBOP):

One of the main difficulties in solving problems like NLBOP is that, unlike single 
objective minimization problems, the definition of an optimal solution is not precise 
or straightforward. An efficient (Pareto optimal, non-inferior, non-dominated) solu
tion for NLBOP is a point 
(S∗,s∗
 such that there exists no other feasible point (S, s) 
that satisfies 
TC(S,s)≤TC(S∗,s∗
 and 
ξW(S,s)≤ξW(S∗,s∗)
 Suppose that 
is a set of all efficient points for the NLBOP. Whenever 
(S∗,s∗)∈E
we find that 
there isn’t a single other feasible point that performs at least as well as 
 in all 
the criteria for problem NLBOP and strictly better in at least one criterion. As a result, 
the Pareto optimal solution has a minimum expected cost or a minimum expected 
waiting time.

To address this issue, the researchers have suggested a number of techniques 
including multi-objectives Genetic Algorithm, multi-objective vortex particle swarm 
optimization etc. We employ Mixed Integer Distributed Ant Colony Optimization 
(MIDACO) solver (Schlüeter et al. 2013) in this work. The Ant Colony Optimiza
tion (ACO) algorithm is the foundation of the MIDACO solver. ACO is an algorithm 
for combinatorial optimization problems that uses population-based meta-heuristics 
algorithm. This algorithm which mimics ant behavior was developed by Dorigo 
(1992) in his Ph.D. thesis. For a thorough analysis and implementation of ACO, we 
recommend the reader to Dorigo and Stützle (2019).
As illustrated in the flowchart (Fig. 3), we compute the MIDACO solution 
using Julia function and the MIDACO solver for Julia. For this study, we fix the 
system parameters as 
µ=5.5;λ=4;θ=4.2;β=0.75;p=0.
 and costs as 
ch1
=2;ch2
=1.5;cs=100;cr=20;cw=10
 Using PlotTool.exe, the Fig. 4 is 
plotted using the output that MIDACO generated. The Fig. 4 displays the Pareto 
front curve between the total cost and waiting time. According to the MIDACO solu
tion, 
(TC∗(S,s), ξ∗
W)=(71.84359479,0.
 and 
(S∗, s∗)=(35,
 are the 
optimal values.
Tables 5 and 6, respectively, show how the system parameters and costs affect the 
MIDACO solution. The upper entries in each table cell give the 
S∗, s
 while the 
lower entries show the optimal expected cost and optimal waiting time. We can see 
the following findings based on the Tables 5 and 6.

In the case of retail inventory management, the challenge for managers is that not all 
products in an ordered lot are in perfect condition when delivered and some may be 
damaged or defective. Accurate identification of these errors is essential for effective 
management of the inventory. To address this problem, the manager could prioritize 
inspections on receipt of orders. In the decision-making process, managers may also 
note that changes in system parameters and costs have a significant impact on the 
management of the total cost of the system and customer waiting time due to the 
uncertainty of dynamic market situations.
The analysis and the numerical results of this paper show that there are several 
insights that will be useful in managing the inventory system that addresses the 
inspection policy for separating defective items from a lot of ordered items. These 
observations focus on the optimal values 
S∗, s∗, TC
and 
relation to system parameters.

and their behavior in 
● A high arrival rate usually results that more stock needs to be kept in the inven
tory and that a high reorder level needs to be set. However, the variation in the 
number of the perfect and defective items in the received lot contributes to the 
inventory’s inability to hold more stock which will also affect the waiting time of 
retrial customer. This can be prevented by setting the repair rate as high as feasi
ble which will enable the defects to be repaired quickly and put back into main 
inventory for use. Increasing the reorder rate and retrial rate helps to reduce total 
costs. The probability of defective items in a received batch has a significant im
pact on the total cost of the system as if it is high, the inventory must be kept with 
more stock and frequent orders must be made. The manager must consider all the 
above-mentioned parameters in order to operate the inventory system optimally.
● The optimal waiting time oscillates with the high arrival rate and high probability 
of defective items as the probability plays a key role in stock maintenance. If it is 
as low as possible, the inventory can be maintained with a larger number of items 
and the waiting time is shortened. Otherwise, the inventory should be maintained 
with a reduced quantity and customers should have to wait longer for their items 
due to lack of inventory. Therefore, the manager must control the optimal level of

inventory and the optimal reorder point in order to maintain the optimal waiting 
time, but this will have an impact on the total cost of the system. Joint optimiza
tion of the total costs and waiting time can only provide a better understanding of 
the behavior of the system.
● In joint optimization, the Pareto front helps decision-makers to understand a 
range of feasible and optimal choices, and to select the best solution for their spe
cific needs, balancing conflicting objectives. Arrival rate plays an important role 
in the optimal total cost while the probability of defective items plays a key role 
in the optimal waiting time. This study shows how important the inspection is for 
the management of the retrial inventory system and how important is to check the 
arrival rate and the probability of defective items.
7 Conclusion and future work
This mathematical model is suitable for managing the inventory of a retailer when 
the retailer is committed to selling high-quality products to its clients. In order to 
check the quality of items before selling them, it is necessary to examine the items 
ordered after filling them in order to determine whether they are perfect or whether 
any defects have occurred. This model is applicable to retailers who perform a 100% 
check on replenished items before stocking the inventory and where any defective 
items are present in the lot, they are stored separately and are repaired before being 
included in the main stock.
In this paper, we have classified items as either perfect or defective after inspec
tion, using error-free inspections with a negligible inspection time. In the continuous 
review, the existing literature treats defective inventory as lost or replaceable goods. 
On the contrary, we propose that such defective articles may be repaired on the prem
ises of the retailer. As a result, we have developed a continuous review inventory 
model including order inspections, repair options for defective items, and customer 
retrials. We derived the joint probability distribution for the number of retrial cus
tomers in the orbit, DI and MI levels. We have calculated the total expected cost of 
the system and the expected waiting time for retrial customers. We have shown the 
convexity of the cost function numerically. We also looked at the effect of the system 
parameters on the total expected cost and the waiting time. Finally, we formulated an 
NLBOP to perform the joint optimization of the total cost and waiting time and the 
optimization was done with the help of the MIDACO solver in Julia.
There are some useful extensions of our model which could form the basis for 
future research efforts in this area. For example, this model could be extended by 
including a general distribution for the arrival process rather than a Poisson distribu
tion. In addition, consideration should be given to the random inspection period; the 
inclusion of service facility in the system would also increase the usefulness of the 
model.
