Abstract
This paper estimates the effect of local e-commerce on labor outcomes in the retail
sector at the county level for the period 2010 to 2017, using the presence of Amazon
fulfillment centers as a proxy. A two-stage event study design is employed, taking
advantage of the staggered rollout of fulfillment centers across U.S. counties. E

Traditional retail establishments face job losses as consumers shift toward online pur
chases due to greater convenience, variety, and lower prices. This initial disruption
phase puts pressure on brick-and-mortar stores, resulting in downsizing and the dis
placement of low-skilled retail workers. Over time, however, an adjustment phase
emerges as small and medium-sized firms adapt by selling their products online.
Through collaboration with platforms like Amazon, these businesses benefit from
reduced shipping costs and access to a larger customer base, leading to the creation
of new high-skilled retail jobs. The results show that total retail employment remains
broadlyunchanged,butthecompositionoftheworkforceshiftsmarkedly.High-skilled
employment increases while low-skilled employment falls, widening the employment
gap. Wages follow a similar trend, with short-run gains for high-skilled workers even
tually giving way to compression, while low-skilled wages steadily decline. These
patterns result in growing within-sector inequality and underscore the uneven labor
market consequences of local e-commerce expansion for workers of different skill
levels.

1 Introduction
Retail e-commerce, first launched in 1982 has grown rapidly since its inception,
accounting for 0.6% of the total sales in 1999 and 8.2% in 2016 (Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis 2025). This is consistent with the rapid increase in the number of
consumers shopping online, with a 2016 survey on consumer behavior reporting 34%
of the survey respondents preferring to shop online instead of in-person; while 28%
of internet users reported shopping online several times a month, and a further 15%
reportedly shopping online on a weekly basis (Pew Research Center 2016). This has
led to traditional brick-and-mortar retailers adding online components to their stores
to reach a larger consumer base. Omni-channel stores have been faring well, with
consumers reserving products online and picking them up from the stores, implying
that consumers still value the physical aspects of shopping.
In this study, I analyze the impact that local e-commerce has on employment and
wages in the retail sector in the county labor markets. The study focuses on the expan
sion of Amazon fulfillment centers, using them as a proxy for local e-commerce
presence. The main aim of this study is to quantify the impact e-commerce has, not
onlyontheretailsectoremploymentbutalsoonthewageandemploymentgapbetween
high- and low-skilled workers.
Amazon is by far the largest e-commerce company in the U.S., with a retail e
commerce market share of 34% in 2016, outweighing the combined market shares of
three of its largest competitors, Walmart, eBay, and Apple. In 2017, the company had
over 100 fulfillment centers spread across nearly 70 counties in the U.S. The lack of
storefronts led to much lower overhead costs as compared to other retailers and was
oneofthemajorreasonsthat helped Amazonswiftlyexpandacrossthecountry. Being
an online seller, Amazon is not required to pay any sales taxes unless it has a physical
presence in a state. Additionally, Amazon signed several tax treaties with the state
and local governments, resulting in large tax breaks. This usually translated into lower
prices of goods online giving it quite an edge over the brick-and-mortar retailers. In
2010, Amazon operated in 17 states but collected sales taxes in only four (Good Jobs
First 2016). Amazon’s sales have been rapidly increasing, with its 2016 sales revenue
increasing by 27% over their 2015 sales figures. The e-commerce seller has also gone
on a hiring spree, with 109,800 full-time and part-time workers in the third quarter of
2013, hiring another 72,900 workers in 2014. Amazon added 39,300 jobs in the third
quarter of 2015 and a further 34,600 in the last quarter of 2016 (Amazon Quarterly
Earnings Reports). They are now second only to the largest private employer in the
U.S., Walmart (Business 2021). Despite these large numbers, many have put forth the
argument that Amazon has caused a massive wipeout of brick-and-mortar retail jobs,
withonereportclaimingthatAmazonhaseliminated149,000retailjobs,farexceeding
the number of jobs that it has created (Institute for Local Self-Reliance 2016), and
another report estimating the number of department store jobs lost from 2012–2016 at
279,000, effectively two or three jobs being destroyed for every job created (Federal
Reserve Bank of St. Louis 2018).
There is no general consensus on the impact of e-commerce on employment and
wages thus far. The general assumption is that, with the advent of e-commerce most
consumers prefer to shop online instead of in-person, effectively destroying the brick
123

and-mortar retail stores. However, jobs are also created via e-commerce, with online
sellers having access to millions of consumers and enabling them to grow at a faster
rate than brick-and-mortar stores and creating new jobs in the retail sector. Using
Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2007-2017, Michael (2018) explored the benefits
of e-commerceintermsofreducingwageinequality and jobcreation. He found that e
commerce had created more jobs than those lost by the brick-and-mortar retail sector,
and suggested that e-commerce reduced the number of unpaid household hours that
goes into shopping at traditional stores and further suggested that these hours could
be shifted to the market sector. Michael (2018), also conducted a county-level wage
analysis and found that fulfillment centers paid an average weekly wage that is 31%
higher than the average weekly wage paid by the brick-and-mortar retail stores in the
samecounty.Chavaetal.(2018),studiedtheimpactofe-commerceontheretailsector
by exploiting the staggered rollout of fulfillment centers. They found that counties
with fulfillment centers experienced a decline in the labor income of 2.4%, and the
effect remained negative and significant for counties lying within 100 miles. Most of
the effect was due to a decline in the number of hours worked. Chava et al. (2018),
also observed a U-shaped pattern in which both young and old workers experienced
a decline in their labor income. All effects became insignificant for counties lying
within 500 miles. Furthermore, they found a decline of 2.4% in employment in all
stores and an exit rate of 3%, with small stores being more likely to exit than larger
stores. Additionally, the entry rate for small stores declined by 11.8%, with this low
entry rate persisting for counties within 100 miles. In contrast, Vikram and Nettessine
(2022) find an overall positive effect of Amazon entry into the counties with a job
gain of 0.7 to 1 percentage points and an increase in the median household income of
1.8–2.2%. Current estimates show that fulfillment centers occupy three-fourths of the
square footage of the U.S.’s entire distribution structure, (Jones and Zipperer 2018)
with Amazonstillexpandingitsfulfillment center network, begging thequestion, does
Amazon harm or benefit the counties that it establishes its fulfillment centers in.
The analysis in this study focuses on the impact of local e-commerce via Amazon
fulfillment centers on the local labor markets using detailed data from the IPUMS and
the American Community Survey to construct information on county characteristics.
ThelogisticscompanyMWPVLprovidesdataonAmazonfulfillmentcentersandtheir
opening dates. Following the approach of Gardner et al. (2024), I exploit the staggered
rollout of the fulfillment centers and use a two-stage difference-in-difference and a
two-stage event study approach to estimate the impact the centers have on the county
labor markets. Counties that have fulfillment centers are considered to be the treated
group, while counties that get centers later in the period under observation, are used
as the control group.
The results show that local e-commerce impacts the retail sector in two distinct
phases. The first is a disruption phase, where goods sold online directly compete with
those sold in brick-and-mortar retail stores, leading to a decline in consumer demand
for in-store purchases. This puts competitive pressure on traditional retailers, forcing
some to downsize or shut down entirely, resulting in job losses-particularly among
low-skilled retail workers. The second phase is an adjustment period, marked by the
growth of small and medium-sized retail firms that adopt e-commerce platforms. By
partnering with Amazon, these firms are able to expand their reach, access a broader
123

consumer base, and focus on scaling their business while fulfillment centers manage
logistics and delivery. This shift leads to a restructuring of the retail workforce, with
rising demand for high-skilled labor in non-Amazon retail settings and a subsequent
creation of new high-skilled retail jobs. The labor market adjustments over time reflect
not only a reallocation of jobs, but also a transformation in the types of roles the retail
sector demands.
Myworkisrelatedtotwostrandsofliterature. The first relates to existing empirical
studies that look at the impact e-commerce has on retail firms in terms of job creation
and compensation to workers. While these studies have also used Amazon fulfillment
centers as a proxy for the presence of local e-commerce, they do not account for the
staggered entry timing and the heterogeneity of treatment. The two-stage difference
in-difference methodology regresses the labor market outcomes on the county and
year fixed effects in the first stage, and the estimates are then subtracted from the
dependent variable. The modified dependent variable is then regressed on the treat
ment, successfully isolating the impact of local e-commerce presence on the retail
sector in the county labor markets. A two-stage event study approach has also been
conducted in a similar manner to observe how the impact of local e-commerce on the
retail sector in the county labor markets, evolve over time. Given that some counties
have multiple fulfillment centers, with additional centers being established a year or
two after the initial fulfillment center entry, the analysis has been further broken down
into the impact of the initial fulfillment center entry versus that of additional centers.
This isolates the differential impact multiple centers have on the retail sector.
Second, this study relates to several studies that look at the impact of technology on
employmentandwages,focusingontheskillcomponentofthejobs.AutorandDavid,
(2001) found that computerization acts as a labor substitute for routine jobs but not
for non-routine ones, while Autor and David, (2015) found that, though automation
does substitute labor, there are ways in which it can complement labor and increase its
productivity as well, leading to higher demand for labor. Thus, e-commerce is treated
as a skill-biased technical change. The rest of the study is structured as follows. The
next section, Sect.2 provides some information on the background of Amazon and
the evolution of the retail sector. Section3 presents the details of the data used, the
empirical model is presented in Sect.4, and the results and the robustness checks are
discussed in Sect.5 and Sect.6, respectively. Section7 concludes the study.
2 Background
2.1 Retail sector
Ranked as the second largest employer in the U.S., the retail industry has faced many
changes over the years, from mom-and-pop stores to the big box retailers, followed
by the rise of e-commerce sellers. A quick look at the retail history suggests that every
few decades the retail formats undergo a change.
The 1700s to 1800s were characterized by mom-and-pop stores, small family
owned stores that could be found in each town, offering general merchandise. The
mid-1800s to the early 1900s, witnessed the entry of department stores with Sears,

Macy’s,andBloomingdale’ssettingupshopinNewYorkandChicago(BigCommerce
2021). This was followed by the emergence of malls beginning in the 1920s, followed
by chain stores established in the 1940s with 7-Eleven launching in 1946 (Lightspeed
2015). The entry of big box retailers occurred in the 1960s, with Walmart opening
its first store in 1962 in Rogers, Arkansas. Amazon launched its website in 1997 and
since then has gone on to become the largest e-commerce retailer in the U.S.
Toputthegrowthofe-commerceinperspective, the quarterly share of e-commerce
sales of the total U.S. retail sales increased from 0.8% in the first quarter of 2000 to
7.7% in the first quarter of 2016. It further increased to 13.6% in the first quarter of
2021(CensusBureau,RetailSalesReport,2021).Inthefaceofincreasingcompetition
from online sellers, several big box retailers filed for bankruptcy in 2015 and 2016,
with Macy’s and Sears being among the many to do so. However, the Pew survey
suggests that Americans aren’t simply abandoning traditional in-store locations for
online purchases. For instance, 65% of online shoppers indicated that they generally
prefer buying from physical outlets if given the choice. Age also plays a role in
shopping preferences, with 72% of Baby Boomers, who grew up with brick-and
mortar stores as their default, primarily shopping in-store, as compared to Millennials,
67% of whom shop online (Pew Research Center, 2016).
2.2 Amazon
Amazon was launched in Seattle, Washington, in 1995 as an online bookstore. The
companywentpublicin1997,andlaterthat year it established two fulfillment centers,
in Seattle and NewCastle,Delaware,respectively. It expanded into music, selling CDs
and DVDs alongside books. In 1999, Amazon allowed third-party sellers to sell used
merchandiseontheirwebsite,bringingaboutahugeincreaseinthetransactionvolume.
In2002,clothingwasaddedtothewebsiteinadditiontoelectronics,kitchenware,toys,
andbooks. Post 2005, Amazonstartedrapidly expanding their fulfillment centers with
aconcentrationintheNortheastandSoutheastregionsoftheU.S.In2017,thecompany
had a net revenue of 177.87 billion dollars, employed 566,000 employees (combined
part-time and full-time), and was the leading online e-commerce seller with 37% of
the market share. In 2023, Amazon’s retail e-commerce market share had grown to
37.6%,farexceedingthecombinedmarketsharesofitstopthreecompetitors,Walmart
(6.4%), Apple (3.6%), and eBay (3%) (Statista 2023).
Amazon used an economic model published by the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis and estimated that it had invested $45 billion in the U.S. economy and
paid $25 billion in wages in 2016 alone (WRAL News 2018). In the early stages of
e-commerce, most of the goods were shipped from out of state; hence, the sellers
would have to collect sales tax in their home state but not in the other states. Amazon
set up one of its first fulfillment centers in Delaware, where there is no state sales
tax and shipped its goods using UPS and FedEx to its consumers in other states,
with effectively no sales tax collection. States argued for several years that they were
losing money by not collecting sales tax on online sellers. On June 1, 2018, the U.S.
Supreme court changed the rules and allowed the individual states to impose sales tax
collection on internet sellers. Jean-Francois et al. (2017), found that Amazon’s choice

Fig. 1 Amazon fulfillment center expansion 1997–2017. Note This figure illustrates the rapid expansion of
Amazon fulfillment centers from two centers in 1997 to 108 FCs spread across the country in 2017. The
data is obtained from the MWPVL Logistics Company
of location for its fulfillment centers was a trade-off between the loss of revenue from
local consumers due totheimposition of sales tax and the cost savings it incurred from
the reduction in shipping distance to the consumers. They found that the cost savings
far outweighed the loss in revenue due to sales taxes. In the context of its distribution
network expansion, this estimate implied that Amazon had reduced its total shipping
cost by over 50% and increased its profit margin between 5 and 14% since 2006.
Separately, they demonstrated that prices on Amazon fell by approximately 40% over
the same period, suggesting that a significant share of the cost savings were passed on
to the consumers. Amazon’s rapid growth influenced different states’ decision to offer
Amazon tax abatements; Amazon had received over $1 billion credits, exemptions,
and infrastructural assistance worth millions of dollars in exchange for performance
based incentives in terms of local job creation. Jones and Zipperer (2018) noted that
by the end of 2016, Amazon had received over $1 billion in state and local subsidies
for its fulfillment centers and argued that Amazon did not create enough employment
to justify these tax breaks and this money would have been better spent on public
services such as early childhood education and infrastructure.
While the New Castle, Delaware, fulfillment center is still in use as of today, the
center in Seattle, Washington, has been converted to a seasonal facility; hence only
one fulfillment center in 1997 is displayed on the map (Fig.1a). By 2007, Amazon
opened 7 fulfillment centers in 6 counties across Delaware, Kentucky, Arizona and
Wisconsin(Fig.1b). By2017,Amazonspreadto108fulfillmentcentersin68counties
(Fig.1c).
These fulfillment centers are designed to not only stock goods but also act as
distribution centers where workers pack and distribute the goods and use computer

by the kind of task carried out in each fulfillment center. There are six such categories.

for small goods such as books, toys, and housewares. Non-sortable centers carry out
the same function as sortable centers except the goods in question are large bulky
orders such as patio furniture or outdoor equipment. Sortation centers, which receive
packages from multiple fulfillment centers, and then the consumers’ orders are sorted
according to their zip codes and loaded into trucks for faster delivery. Receive centers

centers withinthenetwork.Deliverycentershandlelastmileshippingandthespecialty
centershandlespecificcategoriesofgoodsoractassupportcentersforotherfulfillment
centers during peak season (Amazon 2021). There does not seem to be any particular
pattern in the type of fulfillment centers Amazon establishes in different locations. For
example, Amazon entered Arizona in 2007, establishing a specialty fulfillment center
inMaricopaCounty;lateritestablishednon-sortablecenters(in2008,2011,and2015),
and a sortable, seasonal, and return center in 2010, 2015, and 2017, respectively. In
contrast, Amazon entered Florida in 2014 with sortable centers in Orange and Polk
Counties and a non-sortable center in Miami-Dade County. A delivery center was
added to Pinellas County in 2015. Hence, there is no clear indication of the type
of fulfillment centers Amazon establishes in each state, nor is there any consistent
pattern about the type of fulfillment centers established in states that already have a
few fulfillment centers in them. Thus, the analysis focuses on sortable, non-sortable,
specialty, returns and supplemental centers, as similar type of work is conducted in
them.
3 Datadescription
In 2018, Amazon increased its minimum wage to $15, in order to capture the effect
of the fulfillment centers prior to the wage increase, I use county-level data from the
American Community Survey (ACS) for the years 2005-2017 (ACS does not record
countyidentifiers prior to 2005). TheACSreportsarangeofindividualcharacteristics,
suchastheindustrieswhereeachindividualinthesurveyisemployed,numberofhours
worked, level of education, their race and gender information. The data has been
restricted to workers in the directly competing sub-sectors within the retail sector, as
these are most likely to be impacted by Amazon’s entry into a county. The detailed list
of the directly competing sub-sectors is provided in the appendix (Table 8). County
level sales tax information has been obtained from the Department of Revenue (DOR)
of each state. The DORs provide information on the county-level sales tax imposed as
well as the dates of changes of the taxes if any. In case of any changes in sales tax, the
annual weighted average of the sales tax has been used. The Census Bureau provides
the data on county land area, which has been used to calculate county population
density per square mile. The median household income has been calculated based on
the ACSdata. The sumoftheaverage household cost of water, gas, and electricity has

This table displays the staggered treatment timing of fulfillment centers with 37 counties that receive initial
treatment via the establishment of 1 or 2 initial centers. Another 10 counties receive additional centers
during the latter years of the observed time period
EmployerHouseholdDynamicsOrigin–DestinationEmploymentStatistics(LODES).
Thelogistics company MWPVLprovidesinformationonAmazonfulfillmentcenters,
the type of center, and the year opened, as well as the location of the fulfillment center.
Toestimate the impact of local e-commerce via the presence of Amazonfulfillment
centers, the variation in the openings of fulfillment centers in different counties has
been used. The presence of a fulfillment center in a county is defined as the treatment
with a focus on the fulfillment centers established during the years 2010-2017, with
the previous years (2005-2009) being used to test the parallel trends. Counties that
received a center between 2005-2009 are not included in the analysis (there are 47
treated counties between 2010 and2017,with10countiesbeingtreated prior to 2010).
Table1providesinformationonthenumberoffulfillmentcentersaswellasthenumber
ofcountiestreatedacrosstheyears.Thefullsampleretailemploymentdatasetcontains
467 counties, 47 of which are eventually treated and 420 never-treated counties. The
treatment is staggered over time, with 37 counties receiving one or two initial centers
andanother 10counties receiving additional fulfillment centers during the latter years.
Amazon announces its entry into a county publicly at most two years before its
actual entry; hence, the earliest treated county is in 2010 with its anticipated treatment
in 2008,whichleaves2periodsfrom2005to2007astheearliestpre-treatmentperiods.
Tables 2 and 3 below provide the summary statistics on the mean differences between
the counties that eventually receive a center during the observed time period and the
counties that never do in terms of levels and growth in the county characteristics. For
the eventually treated counties, the mean of the levels over-3 to-1 periods before the
anticipated treatment and the mean of the growth in the variables in the same period
is calculated. For the never-treated counties, a pseudo treatment year of 2013 (the

in terms of workers relocating to treated counties or a greater number of workers commuting to the treated
counties, in response to the announcement of an Amazon center being established in the treated counties
median treatment year is assigned) and then similar calculations are conducted for
comparison. This has been done to avoid any noise from a year-to-year comparison.
The eventually treated counties (Table 2), have notably larger total and working
age populations than never-treated counties; they are also substantially more dense
on average. The eventually treated counties also have higher operational costs and
higher median household incomes, as well as a larger number of interstate highways,
freight I railway tracks, and airports as compared to the never-treated counties. This
suggests that Amazon tends to locate in more populous, economically developed
urban areas with better infrastructure. There has not been a significant change in
the infrastructure present in the counties in the observed time period, however, the
eventually treated counties (Table 3) display significant differences in the growth rates
of the total population, working-age population, population density, operational costs,
and the sales taxes, confirming that Amazon chooses to locate its centers in counties
that are not only larger, more urbanized, and economically developed to begin with
but also are on a higher growth trajectory. In this context, the dataset is limited to only
eventually treated counties, using not-yet-treated counties as a control for the treated
counties.
A point of concern is the change in the employment trends and trends in worker
inflows from neighboring counties in response to the announcement of a fulfill
ment center being established in the eventually treated counties. Figure2 displays
the employment trends in the retail sector in never-treated counties as well as eventu
ally treated counties before treatment (that is, not-yet-treated counties) along with the
worker inflows of neighboring counties into treated counties. There is no significant
change in the employment trends or worker inflows, implying that a greater number
of workers are not commuting into the treated counties or moving into the treated
counties in hopes of getting a fulfillment center job. Given that there are no significant
spillover effects from the neighboring counties, not-yet-treated neighboring counties
are retained in the control group.

Another point of concern regarding the staggered rollout of fulfillment centers is
the possibility of dynamic selection across counties over time. Table 4 displays the
pre-treatment county characteristics of eventually treated counties by their cohort in
terms of levels, while Table 5 displays the growth values. Some cohorts (e.g., 2011,
2015) show larger population values and higher costs, while others (2010, 2013) have
smaller populations or different infrastructure patterns. Similarly, some cohorts, like
2008 (1 county) and 2012 (6 counties), exhibit higher population or operational cost
growth, whileothersshownearzeroornegativefigures.Importantly,thereisnomono
tonic progression across the cohorts in either levels or growth terms, suggesting that a
simple “larger, richer counties adopt later” pattern does not exist; rather, each cohort
has distinct characteristics. To further support this argument, the average outcomes of
the eventually treated county characteristics, such as the county population, median
household income, operational costs, and sales taxes (there is no change in the infras
tructure, hence they have been excluded from the plots) for the periods before their
treatment are presented in the Appendix (Fig.3). The figure shows that across all mea
sures, there is no monotonic progression of levels over time: some cohorts enter with
higher values (e.g., population or operational costs), others with lower or declining
values, and several show dips and rebounds (e.g., 2010, 2012, 2013 cohorts). This
heterogeneity confirms that there is no dynamic selection of Amazon into counties.
The final dataset contains 474 observations with 47 eventually treated counties and 10
treated counties receiving additional FCs.
3.1 Dependentvariables
Following the approach of Autor et al. (2013), the sample of workers selected are as
follows; individuals between the ages of 16 and 64 years, provided they worked in
the year preceding the survey. Individuals working in group quarters and institutions
such as prisons have been dropped from the sample along with the self-employed,
unpaid family workers, and those who work in NGOs. Workers with no recorded
wages have been removed from the sample as well. State and counties are identified
with the Federal Information Processing (FIP) Codes; that is, the combination of state
and county FIP codes uniquely identifies counties within each state.
The data for the actual number of weeks worked is not available; however, ACS
provides a range of the weeks worked, and hence the midpoint of the given ranges has
been used. Labor supply is then calculated as the product of the weeks worked and
the usual number of hours worked, weighted by the person weights (the number of
people in the U.S. population represented by a given person in an IPUMS sample).
Hourly wages are computed as the yearly wage and salary income divided by the
product of weeks worked and usual number of hours worked in a week. Following
Autoretal. (2013), top-coded yearly wagesaremultipliedbyafactorof1.5andhourly
wages are set not to exceed this value divided by 50 weeks times 35hours. Hourly
wages below the first percentile of the national hourly wage distribution are set to the
value of the first percentile. Wages are inflated to the year 2017 using the Personal
ConsumptionExpenditure Index, Autor et al. (2013). A dummyvariableforeducation
is used, with workers having a year or more of college education being assigned the

value one. The dataset is then aggregated based on the year, county, and education
dummy, resulting in the average wages based on the skill level as well as the number
of high- and low-skilled workers employed in the retail sector in each county per year.
The ratio of high- and low-skilled employment as well as the ratio of the average
high- and low-skilled wages represents the skill and wage gap between the high- and
low-skilled workers, respectively. The total retail industry employment as a share of
the working-age population, the number of high-skilled retail workers as a share of
the working-age population, the number of low-skilled retail workers as a share of
the working-age population, as well as the average high-skilled wages, average low
skilled wages, the retail employment skill gap, and the wage skill gap form the seven
dependent variables in the analysis.
3.1.1 Independent andcontrol variables
There are 47 treated counties in the data, with 37 counties having just 1 fulfillment
center established in them and 10 counties receiving additional fulfillment centers.
Theindependent variables are two dummies; the first accounts for the treated counties
having at least one fulfillment center, and the second accounts for the presence of
additional fulfillment centers. This allows for the differential impact between the first
time a county receives treatment and the additional effect from having more centers
established in these counties later on. The implicit assumption here is that, although
the first fulfillment center may have a distinct impact, the second, third, fourth, and
any additional centers exert a similar effect on the retail labor market. Given the varia
tion in county sizes, the regression equations have been weighted by the working-age
population in the treated counties a year prior to anticipated treatment. This ensures
that the estimated average treatment effects are more representative of the underly
ing population affected by the treatment. Importantly, using pre-treatment weights
avoids post-treatment bias. The change in the number of women employed, the num
ber of college-educated, and the number of foreign-born population a year prior to the
anticipated treatment have been used as the control variables in the analysis.
Amazon’s choice of county and its timing of entry are both non-random and hence
the dataset is restricted to eventually treated counties only. Within the eventually
treated county dataset, the choice of county and timing of entry can be predicted by
time-invariant county characteristics such as the infrastructure and population or time
varying factors that influence entry. Both the time-invariant and time-varying factors
are accountedforwithcountyandyearfixedeffectsrespectively.Insection6,Iprovide
a more detailed discussion on why the factors predicting the entry choice and timing
are accounted for through the two fixed effects for eventually treated counties. As
part of the robustness checks, I also use a nearest-neighbor matching between treated
and never-treated counties based on the total population, working-age population,
medianhouseholdincome,salestax,numberofInterstatehighways,numberoffreight
I railway tracks and number of airports in levels and the growth rates from-3 to-1
periods before the anticipated treatment for total population, working-age population,
population density, operational costs, and sales tax (all county characteristics with
significant p-values from (Tables 2 and 3).

4 Empirical model
In this study, I analyze the impact of local e-commerce proxied by the presence
of Amazon fulfillment centers on the county labor market. To capture this effect,
the variation in the staggered rollout of fulfillment centers across counties and time
has been exploited. Assuming that the county-specific treatment timing is exogenous
conditional on county and year fixed effects for the eventually treated counties, a
difference-in-difference analysis has been conducted. The treatment is defined as the
presence of fulfillment centers in a county and is further divided into the initial and
additional treatment for counties that received multiple fulfillment centers. The not
yet-treated counties form the control group. The model also assumes irreversibility
of treatment, once a county gets a fulfillment center; that is the treatment, it remains
treated. Hence, only centers that are still in operation during the observed time period
have been considered. Amazon announces its entry into a county at most two years
ahead of the actual entry; thus a 2 year anticipation of the entry timing has also been
assumed. The standard difference-in-difference regression setup is as follows
Yit = αi +αt +βFCit +γadditional FCit + it
(1)
where i indexes the counties, and t indexes the calendar time in years, with αi and αt
denoting the county andtimefixedeffects, respectively. The initial treatment status for
each county across time is represented by, FCit, the dummy for the fulfillment center
presence in a county in the year of establishment and subsequent years. The additional
FC takes on a similar interpretation, a dummy for the presence of additional centers
in the year of establishment and subsequent years.
Recent literature has shown that, when the adoption of treatment is staggered
over time with heterogeneous treatment effects across groups and time, the standard
difference-in-difference methodology does not represent the weighted average of the
unit-level treatment effects (Kirill and Hull 2020; Athey and Imbens 2022; Goodman
Bacon 2021; de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfoeuille September 2020;Imaietal.2023;
Sun and Abraham 2021), and the estimates do not identify an easily interpretable
estimate of the treatment. The fulfillment center entries vary considerably, and the
treatment effect is likely to vary over time for the following reason. As Amazon’s rep
utation as an e-commerce platform grows, more sellers are likely to migrate online,
increasing product variety andofferingcompetitiveprices.Thiswillinduceconsumers
to buy more online in lieu of brick-and-mortar stores with the effect increasing over
time. Hence, the treatment effect cannot be considered to be constant, and a two-way
f
ixed-effect model will bias the estimates.
4.1 Mainspecifications
In this study, I rely on Gardner et al. (2024) straightforward and easy to interpret
two-stage difference-in-difference methodology, which is robust to treatment effect
heterogeneitywhentheadoptionisstaggered.FollowingGardneretal.(2024)method
ology, in the first stage, I regress the outcome on the county and year effects, as well as

the control variables on the untreated subsample FCit = 0, the untreated subsample
being the not-yet-treated counties. In the second stage, the estimated county and year
effects are subtracted from the outcome, and the adjusted outcome is then regressed
on the two treatment variables. Under the usual parallel trends assumption, this pro
cedure identifies the overall average effect of the treatment on the treated (i.e., across
counties and years), even when average treatment effects are heterogeneous (Gardner
et al. 2024). The regression equations are given as follows.
First Stage Regression on the untreated subsample is:

ment as a share of the working-age population, the high-skilled workers employed as
a share of the working-age population, the low-skilled workers employed as a share
of the working-age population, and the average hourly wages for high-skilled and
low-skilled workers, as well as the employment gap and wage gap between high- and
low-skilled workers in county i at time t. A set of county characteristics (the change in
the college-educated population, female-employed population, and the foreign-born
population a year prior to the anticipated treatment) is included as controls in the
f
irst stage as denoted by Xit. The regressions are weighted by the baseline working
age population, measured as the working-age population a year prior to anticipated
treatment, to correctly account for the initial size of the county labor market without
introducing any post-treatment bias.
In the second stage, the adjusted outcome is regressed on the two treatment statuses
for the full sample (the already treated and the not-yet-treated counties), that is.

The PostFC−1t andthePost additional FC−1t havebeendroppedfromtheestima
tion to prevent multicollinearity issues, and all the coefficient estimates are treated as
percentage changes relative to the outcome that existed a year prior to the antic
ipated establishment of the initial and additional fulfillment centers, respectively.
The two-stage difference-in-difference methodology is then extended to the event
study case by modifying the second stage and regressing the adjusted outcome Ait on

Given that there are a small number of treated counties; in order to avoid small sample
bias, the pre-trends and the post-trends for the initial FC presence beyond the 4th year
is pooled together, that is the 5th to 9th years are combined. Similarly, the pre-trends
for additional FCs beyond the 2nd year (3rd to 9th year pre-trends) and the post-trends
for additional FCs beyond the second year (3rd to 5th year post-trends) are combined.
Aconcern arises with the two-stage difference-in-differences estimator, given that
the second stage relies on an outcome that has already been residualized in the first
stage, which could in principle bias standard errors. This issue is addressed in Gard
ner et al. (2024), wherein they show that the two stages can be interpreted jointly as
a single regression estimated within a conventional joint GMM framework. In prac
tice, the first stage partials out group and period effects using untreated observations,
and the second stage then regresses the residualized outcomes on the treatment sta
tus. Because this procedure can be estimated using the joint GMM procedure, the
resulting estimator is equivalent to estimating both stages simultaneously, ensuring
valid asymptotic inference. Thus, rather than producing biased standard errors, the
two-stage framework delivers consistent estimates with correct inference even under
heterogeneous treatment effects and staggered adoption.
5 Results
Table 6 presents the two-stage difference-in-difference results of the impact of local
e-commerce on the retail sector employment via the presence of Amazon fulfillment
centers. The analysis focuses only on counties that eventually receive a fulfillment
center during the period under analysis, 2010-2017, using the yet-to-be treated coun
ties as the control group for the already treated counties. The estimates capture the
average impact on counties receiving at least one fulfillment center (the initial FC)
and the marginal effect of receiving additional FCs. The results show that while retail
employment as a share of the working-age population increases slightly following the
establishment of an Amazon FC (+1.95% for the initial FC and +2.30% for additional
FCs);theseestimatesarenotstatisticallysignificant.Thissuggeststhattheoveralllevel
of retail employment remains broadly unchanged, masking underlying compositional
shifts. In contrast, the high-skilled retail employment as a share of the working-age
population increases substantially and significantly after both initial (+11.18%) and
additional FCs (+8.98%).Thislikelyresults fromAmazon’ssupportforsmallretailers
to sell online, which creates new job opportunities in the retail sector. The new jobs
created by small online retailers supported by Amazon may demand higher-skilled

workers, as these roles involve e-commerce management, digital marketing, and cus
tomer service, which require more skills than traditional retail roles. The results also
show a significant decline in low-skilled retail employment following the first FC
(−6.42%), with smaller and statistically insignificant declines associated with subse
quent FCs, suggesting that the establishment of the Amazon fulfillment center exerts
competitive pressure on traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, leading to job losses in
the sector. This pattern suggests that most of the displacement of routine low-skilled
roles (e.g., cashiers, stock clerks) occurred due to the initial entry of Amazon, after
which the labor market adjusts to the presence of the fulfillment center. The combined
effect is a substantial and statistically significant widening of the employment gap
between high- and low-skilled retail workers (+17.59% after the first FC; +10.89%
with subsequent FCs). Thesefindingsindicate the emergence ofamorestratifiedretail
sector, with jobs increasingly favoring higher-skilled individuals.
Table 7 presents the two-stage difference-in-difference results on the retail sector
wages. Thewageoutcomesalsoreflect thepolarization between high- and low-skilled
workers. The initial FC widens the wage gap between high- and low-skilled workers
(+9.18%); it narrows (insignificantly) with additional FCs (−5.73%). This pattern
is largely driven by changes in high-skilled retail wages, with a significant 7.38%
increase after the first FC, followed by a significant 11.62% decline with additional
FCs. This suggests an initial period of demand for high-skilled workers, followed by
wagenormalizationorcompressionasAmazon’sfootprintexpands.Low-skilledwage
effects are negative but statistically insignificant, implying that displacement is more

FCs do not lead to a net expansion in retail employment but instead a restructuring
of the local retail labor market. High-skilled retail workers benefit disproportionately
from the firm’s presence, both in terms of employment and wages, especially during
the early stages of expansion. Meanwhile, low-skilled workers experience job loss and
stagnation, resulting in significant increases in within-sector inequality (Table 8).
Table 9 presents the event study estimates from a two-stage design, capturing the
dynamiceffectsofAmazonfulfillmentcenter(FC)openingsontheretailemployment.
While overall retail employment is not significantly impacted due to the entry of
FCs, I observe substantial and persistent changes in employment composition. High
skilled retail employment increases significantly from the year of treatment onward,
with cumulative gains exceeding 16% beyond the fourth year. In contrast, low-skilled
retail employment declines sharply, particularly in the second and third years after
FC entry. Subsequently, the employment gap between high- and low-skilled retail
workers rises significantly, indicating pronounced labor market polarization within
the retail sector. Additional FCs reinforce these trends, particularly with respect to
high-skilled employment growth. These dynamic results align closely with the two
stage DiD estimates presented in Table 6, which found large and significant positive
effects on high-skilled retail employment and significant negative effects on low
skilled retail employment, resulting in a widening employment gap. The event study
adds nuance by highlighting the timing of these effects and confirming that structural
shifts in the retail workforce unfold gradually over multiple years, rather than as an
immediate shock. The pre-treatment coefficients are mostly insignificant except for a
significance at Pre add FC (2), that is the pre-trends two years prior to the anticipated

This table shows two-stage difference-in-differences estimates for retail employment outcomes, focusing on how the arrival and expansion of fulfillment centers affect overall,
high-skilled, and low-skilled retail labor. The results suggest that while the presence of an FC boosts high-skilled retail work, it appears to dampen low-skilled employment,
leading to a notable shift in the composition of the retail workforce

This table reports two-stage difference-in-differences estimates for high- and low-skilled retail wages, revealing a positive effect of the first fulfillment center on high-skilled
hourly pay but a negative impact once an additional FC is established. Meanwhile, low-skilled hourly wages remain largely unchanged when the first FC arrives, though the
second FC appears to slightly reduce wage levels for both skill categories

entry of the additional fulfillment centers in the county. This isolated deviation, while
statistically significant at the 10% level, is not accompanied by a broader pattern of
upward drift and is unlikely to drive the sustained post-treatment divergence observed
in the event windows that follow. Importantly, the event study plots presented in Fig.4
in the Appendix, serve asanadditional validity check, visually confirming the absence
of systematic pre-trends and reinforcing the causal interpretation of the post-treatment
effects.
Table 10 presents two-stage event study estimates assessing the impact of Amazon
fulfillment center entry on retail wages and wage gap between high- and low-skilled
workers. The results reveal an uneven pattern of wage adjustments by skill level.
High-skilled retail workers experience a statistically significant 7.3% increase in the
average hourly wages in the year of FC entry, consistent with immediate demand
for managerial and technical talent within Amazon-aligned retail operations. How
ever, this initial gain is followed by a sharp and statistically significant decline in
response to the arrival of additional FCs, suggesting the presence of wage normal
ization, labor market saturation, or increasing monopsony power as Amazon’s local
footprint expands. In contrast, low-skilled retail wages show a delayed but persistent
decline, becoming statistically significant by the fourth year post-treatment. The net
effect is a sustained widening of the wage gap between high- and low-skilled retail
workers, which peaks around two to four years after initial treatment. These findings
are closely aligned with the earlier two-stage difference-in-differences results, which
also documented a significant initial increase in high-skilled wages followed by com
pression, alongside a decline in low-skilled wages. The event study further clarifies
the timing and persistence of these effects, confirming that wage inequality within the
retail sector emerges gradually but consistently after Amazon FC entry. Together with
the employment effects, the results offer strong evidence of skill-biased restructuring
within the retail sector, where technological and operational shifts favor high-skilled
labor while displacing and devaluing low-skilled roles.
The presence of Amazon fulfillment centers in a county act as a proxy for local
e-commerce affecting the retail sector in two ways, as a competitor for the consumer’s
demand, negatively impacting local businesses (competition effect) and as a platform
for firms to sell their goods on, which the firms can use to expand their business
(collaboration effect). The contrasting effects observed in the two phases (initial ful
f
illment center andadditional centers being established later in those counties) provide
a nuanced understanding of the impact of local e-commerce on the retail sector. There
is an initial disruption of the retail sector with the entry of the first fulfillment center.
Jean-Francois et al. (2017), analyzed the factors driving Amazon’s location choices
between 1999 and 2018 and found that Amazon’s choice of location is a trade-off
between the loss of revenue from local consumers due to the imposition of sales tax
and the cost savings it incurs from the reduction in shipping distance to the con
sumers. They also demonstrate that prices on Amazon fell by approximately 40%
during this period, suggesting that a significant share of the cost savings was passed
on to consumers. The lowered prices and the increased product variety offered induce
consumers to shop more online instead of in-person from brick-and-mortar retailers.
This loss of consumer demand forces stores to downsize or close altogether, leading
to low-skilled job loss.

However, as Amazon expands with additional fulfillment centers, the local retail
sector adapts and grows, with significant job creation driven by Amazon’s support for
small online retailers. This reinforces the high-skilled job creation effects of the initial
FC. Amazon, in its 2021 small business report stated that it sources more than 50%
of its goods from third-party sellers (Amazon 2021), most of which are local small
and medium retail stores. Amazon also has various investment programs in place to
help small businesses sell online. Adopting e-commerce gives these firms access to a
large consumer base; additionally, the fulfillment by Amazon program (FBA) allows
small firms to ship their goods to the nearest fulfillment centers and get them picked,
packed, and shipped using the Amazon distribution network resulting in a significant
cost savings for small and medium firms. This allows the retail firms to focus solely
on growing their business and results in job creation as they expand.
Asurvey by Lendios of more than 2000 small business owners showed that most
viewed Amazon as a threat to their growth opportunities; however this statement is
not in line with the numbers that show the increased growth of two-thirds of small
businesses (Forbes 2019). Another survey stated that 85 percent of business owners
agreed that selling their goods online generated more revenue as compared to the
physical stores, (TechNet 2024). A study by Grandon and Pearson (2004) examining
the factors determining e-commerce adoption by small and medium firms in the U.S.
points to organizational readiness in terms of economic costs and lack of technolog
ical knowledge being the distinguishing factor between adopters and non-adopters.
Amazon, through its small business investment programs helps local businesses sell
online with both funds and the technical know-how needed to sell online; additionally,
the proximity to the fulfillment centers lowers the shipping costs. Amazon has been
hosting third-party sellers on its website since 2000 and has sold 120 million differ
ent commodities worldwide, with 50% of the goods being provided by independent
sellers by the third quarter of 2017 (Statista 2025). It is reasonable for small firms
to want to sell on Amazon, given that Amazon is where most of the consumers are,
with 31 million Prime members in 2014, which grew to 65 million in 2016 (Statista
2019).Furthermore,53%ofproductsearchesstartonAmazonandonly23%onsearch
engines, many of which lead back to Amazon. The remaining 16% of the searches
are on a retailer or brand website and 8% in other marketplaces, with possibly many
of those searches going back to Amazon for price comparison or free shipping with
Prime, (Forbes 2021). A survey from NetElixir found that 60.2% of small businesses
selling products online received at least half of their online sales income from Ama
zon, Jet, and eBay while for another 26.6% selling on these three websites and its own
website, the sales were fifty-fifty (MarTech 2017). This partnership helps the firms
reach millions of consumers and grow at a faster rate, in turn resulting in the creation
of non-Amazon retail jobs.
The partnership is highly beneficial to Amazon as well, with the retail e-commerce
giant charging the sellers 10-15% commission on each item sold. In 2020, Amazon
made 45 million dollars from seller fees (commission for selling on Amazon) and
another 30milliondollarsfrom"fulfillmentbyAmazon"(thelogisticsservicesoffered
to the sellers). The steep commission hurts the sellers; however, as one small business
owner succinctly put it, “I am not happy with it [the rate], but you do get a constant
stream of millions of users, you are paying for those millions” (The Guardian 2015).

Sellers chose to partner with Amazon not only to access a wider consumer base but
also to have the ability to focus on growing their business while Amazon handles the
logistics. Sellers choose Amazon for potential high sales volume, brand recognition,
and the website’s infrastructure.
The results for the low-skilled job loss due to the initial fulfillment center entry are
in keepingwithChavaetal.(2018),whofoundthattheestablishmentofthefulfillment
centers results in a loss of retail sales and a decline in the retail sector jobs for both
treated and neighboring counties. The high-skilled job gains from the establishment
of additional centers are in line with Vikram and Nettessine (2022), who found that
fulfillment center entries increased the county employment as a share of the working
age population by 0.7 to 1 percentage points with a corresponding increase of 1.8 to
2.2% in the median household income. Foster et al. (2006) analysis of the retail sector
suggests that the reallocation of activity across stores is driven by the entry of new
and more efficient firms and the expansion of successful ones, and this accounts for
most of the gains in overall retail productivity.
Amazonhaschangedthewayconsumersshop;however,itcannotbesolelyblamed
for the demise of brick-and-mortar retail stores. Consumers now want the same online
shopping experience while shopping in-person, with a recent study showing that 92%
of shoppers prefer stores that offer mobile experiences with 61% of the consumers
preferring to speak to a kiosk rather than speaking with a sales associate, (Antonio
et al. 2021). Hortacsu and Syverson (2015) also discuss the dual effect of e-commerce
as a competitor and collaborator for retail firms. They further highlight the continued
importance of physical retail stores, albeit with an emphasis on investment in tech
nology being highly correlated with retail growth, which need not necessarily be via
the adoption of e-commerce. Doms et al. (2004) also find that retail establishments’
productivity levels and growthratesarecorrelatedwiththeirinvestmentininformation
technologies. Furthermore, research by the Institute for Competitiveness and Prosper
ity Institute for Competitiveness and Prosperity (2010) suggests that larger retailers
employ better management practices and thereby contribute to sector-wide produc
tivity growth. As things currently stand, businesses regardless of their size, need to
evolve to meet changing consumer demands and shopping preferences, with those
establishing multichannel sales benefiting the most.
6 Robustnesschecks
A concern with using the variation in fulfillment center openings as the empirical
strategy is that Amazon’s timing of entry into counties, as well as its choice of which
counties to enter, is potentially non-random. This raises the possibility that underlying
differences across counties—such as local economic growth, infrastructure, or labor
market conditions—may be driving both treatment and outcomes. To address this,
I restrict the sample to eventually treated counties and exploit variation in the tim
ing of treatment across them. Within this restricted sample, all time-invariant county
characteristics are absorbed by county fixed effects, and any time-varying shocks
common across counties are captured by year fixed effects. As a result, the identifi
cation comes purely from within-county changes in the retail labor market following
123
Impact of e-commerce onlocal retail markets…
Page 25 of 40
   19 
the staggered entry of fulfillment centers, alleviating concerns about selection bias in
Amazon’s county-level entry decisions. As an additional check to assess the robust
ness of the main findings, I replicate the two-stage difference-in-differences and event
study analyses using a nearest-neighbor matched dataset in which each treated county
is matched to the most similar never-treated county based on pre-treatment character
istics that differ significantly in their means both in terms of levels and growth. The
pre-treatment characteristics are, total population, working-age population, median
household income, sales tax, number of Interstate highways, number of freight I rail
way tracks, and number of airports the year prior to the anticipated treatment and the
change in the total population, working-age population, population density, opera
tional costs, and sales tax from-3 to-1 periods before the anticipated treatment. The
matched dataset has 317 observations with 33 treated and 33 never-treated counties.
Thismatcheddesignservesasarobustnesscheckbyconstructingacleanercounter
factual group, minimizing concerns related to heterogeneous treatment timing among
eventually treated counties. The matched sample results, shown in Tables 11, 12,
13 and 14, closely mirror the patterns documented in the main specification. Ama
zon FC entry leads to a significant increase in high-skilled retail employment and a
decline in low-skilled retail employment, with no meaningful change in total retail
employment, confirming the within-sector restructuring observed previously. These
patterns are echoed in the wage results, where high-skilled retail wages rise initially
and decline with additional FCs, while low-skilled wages gradually fall, contributing
to a widening and statistically significant wage gap. The event study results using the
matched sample reinforce the timing and persistence of these effects, showing no evi
dence of pre-treatment divergence and sharp post-treatment shifts that are consistent
with a structural transformation of the local retail labor market. Overall, the matched
sample estimates strongly validate the main findings and confirm that the documented
employment and wage polarization in the retail sector is not an artifact of control
group composition.
7 Conclusion
In this study, I analyze the impact of local e-commerce on the retail sector via the
establishment of fulfillment centers in the counties. The presence of local e-commerce
impacts workers with different levels of skill within the retail sector.
E-commerce serves a dual purpose, as a competitor for consumer demand as well
as a platform for the small brick-and-mortar retailers to sell their goods on. Con
sumers buy more online in lieu of shopping in-person at the brick-and-mortar stores
given lower prices, greater product variety, and the quick delivery options available
online. However, the growth of small firms due to the small-firm–Amazon collab
oration creates high-skilled non-Amazon retail jobs. Using detailed population data
from the American Community Survey, I find that the entry of Amazon fulfillment
centers leads to a shift in the composition of retail employment, rather than a change in
its overall level. High-skilled retail employment increases significantly following the
establishment of a fulfillment center, while low-skilled retail employment declines.
Wages follow a similar trend, with high-skilled retail wages rising initially and falling
123
   19 
Page 26 of 40
U. Mookerjee
with the arrival of additional centers, while low-skilled wages decline over time. As
a result, both the employment and wage gaps between high- and low-skilled retail
workers widen in the years following fulfillment center entry.
These results are robust to using a matched sample of treated and never-treated
counties and hold across both difference-in-differences and event study designs.
The findings highlight that the staggered entry of multiple fulfillment centers gen
erates uneven labor market consequences, benefiting high-skilled workers more than
low-skilled workers, and widening inequality within the retail sector. These patterns
underscore the importance of investing in local reskilling efforts for low-skilled retail
workers, supporting transitions into more tech-integrated roles, and ensuring that the
gains from local e-commerce expansion are more equitably distributed across the
workforce.

Table highlights the event study estimates for both high- and low-skilled retail wages, showing how each pre-and post-treatment window compares to baseline. High-skilled
wages often rise significantly in the initial post-treatment periods, whereas low-skilled wages exhibit more modest or sometimes negative shifts, implying that the arrival of
fulfillment centers has an uneven impact on wage levels across skill segments
